# Titanic_Data_Analysis
This is simple data analysis project using the Titanic Dataset. It marks the completion of my **Month 1** in my self-guided 3-month Machine Learning Career Path.

## 🔍 Dataset
Dataset: Titanic dataset by [Khashayar Baghizadeh](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heptapod/titanic)
Source: kaggle

## 🎯 Project Objective
1. Explore and clean the dataset.
2. Perform descriptive statistics.
3. Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
4. Calculate summary stats(mean,median,standard deviation)
5. Plot correlation heatmap and trends.
6. Draw initial insights from the data.

## 🛠 Tools Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- Pandas, Numpy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ✅ Final Conclusion
- Most passengers who survived were in Pclass 1 and 2, an females had a high survival rate.
- Age and Fare have moderate correlations with survival, while gender(Sex) is strongly associated.
- This notebook demonstartes proficiency in basic EDA(Exploratory Data Analysis) and Visualizations.
